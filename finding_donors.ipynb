    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**Support Vector Machines**\n",
    "\n",
    "Applications- Support Vector Machines are widely used in bioscience, text and hypertext categorization, and classification of images. The ability to classify text is fascinating. It uses training data to classify different document texts such as news, articles, web pages and emails. For example, SVM models can differentiate a news into several ways like business, sports, entertainment, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strengths- SVMs are very effective when the number of features are more than the number of samples. The outliers have low impact on the model because the hyperplane is affected by only the support vectors. SVMs are capable to handle higher dimensional data, hence fast to train/test without using the non-linear kernels. It is one of the best algorithms when classes are separable and perfectly suitable for binary classification problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weakness- SVMs have this feature of kernel trick to select kernels like linear, polynomial, gaussian and so on. Sometimes selecting the correct kernel type is tricky. The non-linear kernels are computationally slow when dealing with large datasets. SVMs are also not prone to overlapping classes. Selecting suitable hyperparameters in SVM for better generalization can also be a daunting task at times. \n",
    "\n",
    "Suitability- Given the imbalance of class in our data and a problem from the book of binary classification, SVM is one of the appropriate choices. Moreover, since our data is not so large, linear SVC would perform decent both in terms of speed and accuracy than a non-linear SVC for our case.\n",

    "\n",
    "**AdaBoost Classifier**\n",
    "\n",
    "Applications- AdaBoost is used in real world problems such as customer churn prediction, classification of customers and face detection applications. It is used in Voila Jones face detection which has a rejection cascade of layers of AdaBoost classifiers. If any detection window does not recognize face , it rejects and moves on to the next one. AdaBoost is used for feature selection and hence reduces the associated computational costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strengths- AdaBoost algorithms improve the predictive power of weak classifiers. Hence, they use weak classifiers for cascading very efficiently. Different sets of weak algorithms can be used in AdaBoost, hence it is not restricted to a single type of weak learner. It overcomes the problem of random guessing, taking each classfier weight into consideration resulting in a stronger model. AdaBoost ensemble technique allows to capture non-linear relationships in data, hence eliminating the flaws of linear models to facilitate better prediction results. \n",
    "\n",
    "Weakness- The weak classifiers in the model being weak lead to overfitting and low margins if not tuned properly. The data imbalance sometimes results in inaccurate classification accuracy.The training and prediction of the model is often time consuming process and it is also vulnerable to uniform noise. \n",
    "\n",
    "Suitability- AdaBoost extends beyond binary classfication problems, hence the boosting technique can be used to make more accurate predictions. AdaBoost has a high degree of precision which is an apt requirement in our case, since our focus is on correctly identifying the donors with income more than 50K. Our dataset contains both numeric and textual data. AdaBoost is flexible with different data types.\n",

    "**Gradient Boosting Classifier**\n",
    "\n",
    "Applications- Gradient Boosting (GB) algorithms find its use in a variety of problems such as sentiment analysis, text classification, and even Electromyography (EMG) to classify human muscle activities based on EMG sensor readings. \n",
    "\n",
    "Strengths- Gradient Boosting models improve the performance of weak learners similar to AdaBoost. This ensemble technique performs better because instead of reweighting the weak classfiers, it makes predictions based on the residual loss using gradients. The training and prediction time is considerable given its high prediction accuracy. GB models have the ability to build sparse models even with high dimensional data. They are flexible and can be customized to different needs given they can capture non-linear relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weakness- One of the drawback of Gradient boosting is its memory consumption. The problem arises when we have to store a high number of weak learners. Further, GB models minimize the errors to the point that it might cause overfitting. This might require using cross validation instead. The high flexibility to tune the hyperparameters requires large grid search during tuning which can be a tiring process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suitability: Gradient Boosting allows for more accurate and precise scores because of its boosting technique. Given our data, GB models can handle the imbalance in data quite efficiently by training the incorrectly classified incomes(=<50K) repeatedly till the errors are minimized to a certain threshold.\n",

    "From the results obtained above, Gradient Boosting Classifier is the most appropriate model for classifying income. The priority of the task at hand is to be absolutely precise when differentiating incomes. An inaccurate classification would cause the non-profit organization to request donation from an individual whose income is below 50K. Hence, this would reduce the likelihood of recieving donations. The F Score is the top metric to evaluate the results rather than the accuracy score since we are focusing on precision than recall in this case. When training the models, GradientBoosting and AdaBoost both improved linearly as we increased the sample size of the training data, whereas Support Vector Machines(LinearSVC) did not demonstrate any improvement. Though AdaBoost Classifier is fairly close, it cannot be chosen as the optimal model especially when model prediction time is the second priority. Gradient Boosting Classifier takes significantly more time to train than AdaBoost but it's model prediction time is spot on and AdaBoost is computationally the slowest consuming twice the time taken by GradientBoost for making predictions on the testing dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "In binary classification problems, we try to predict whether a given data point belongs to a particular class or not. One of the challenges in this dataset we came across was the imbalance of class. Only 24.78% of people have income more than 50K. This is how real-time data looks like and hence, class imbalance is one of the important characteristics to take into account. Gradient Boosting (GB) eliminates the need to apply additional techniques such as stratification which deal with class imbalance. GB models construct training sets based on incorrectly classified samples. It identifies the flaws of the weak learners (which have low performance metrics) and makes the model better by boosting the focus directly on the residual errors using gradients. It allows to optimize different types of loss functions along with the flexibility to tune hyperparameters. It is the one of the ideal choices in our case as it allows more control over AdaBoost.\n",

    "\n",
    "Gradient Boosting Classifiers belong to the category of supervised machine learning algorithms called boosting ensemble methods. The idea behind Gradient Boosting is to combine the weak learning algorithms and make more accurate predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "A weak learner is a machine learning algorithm that gives better accuracy than simple guessing. For instance, if you are trying to classify flowers, a learner which classifies roses accurately than sunflowers, then it is a weak learner. Because it can atleast classify roses correctly, which is better than random guessing. If a learner classifies every flower as a rose, then it would not be a weak learner since it is not any better than guessing. For boosting problems, the best types of weak learners are those that are very accurate, even if it is accurate for a selected scope in a problem. This way, if weak leaner 1 can be accurate in classifying roses, weak learner 2 can focus on sunflowers, and so on. Essentially, weak learners are best combined to work on a subsection of problem, hence making the boosting process efficient. \n",
    "\n",
    "Weak learners can be any machine learning algorithm such as neural network, svm, but the most commonly used weak learner is decision tree. A decision tree is basically a a type of flowchart which gives an answer in yes or no. In our case, the decision tree output is whether an individual earns above 50k or not. The input are the features like age, education, etc which are used to make a decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the training process, the boosting algorithm focuses more on inaccurate predictions, and prioritizes the correct prediction of those in the next round of training. Every next iteration, the model finds the best learner (or decision tree) to incorporate into the ensemble, and leverage this process till any more corrections can be made further. All these learners are  combined to make a final ensembled model. Among them, they vote and the majority of votes decides the winner who makes the final prediction. Thus, using the census data, the boosting model can predict the income for a potential new donor and find out if they earn more than 50K or not, and thus making a decision yes/no on the likelihood of getting a donation."

    "I evaluated 4 out of the 5 features correctly during the EDA phase. However, the ranking of the features was a bit different. Nonethless, these make sense because income is essentially derived from how much a person works i.e. (the hours per week), age- a crucial factor, education-num meaning the level of education of a donor. Academically qualified individuals will possibly earn more than 50K. Capital gain makes sense because it gives information about the investments of the donor. Hence, it would provide a better idea about their financial status. Lastly, the feature sex which I predicted did not grab a place in the top five. Understandly so, because sex has only 2 values- male or female and it may be difficult to draw patterns on their income relying only on the two values. Instead capital loss is more relevant since it complements capital gain and more so using both these data points, the financial status of an indivual would be even more interpretable, hence resulting in an overall stronger predictive power.

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
